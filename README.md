_It ships Kivy right to you!_

Everyone can mess things up even with simple installation or update. In
version `1.8.0` there was a batch file for making things easier for beginners
or regular users, but this file disappeared as the wheel came in. KivyInstaller
is inspired by this `kivy.bat` file from the old portable package with multiple
new functions.

Read the [docs](http://kivyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/master/) or watch
a [video](https://youtu.be/ch_ILDBEaok) and find more features!

1. Create a folder for your Python and place `kivy.bat` inside.
   You can do so directly from the command line with:

       mkdir python
       bitsadmin /transfer "GetBatch" "https://git.io/vDDjn" "%cd%\python\kivy.bat"
       cd python

2. Run `kivy.bat`, select your Python and Kivy versions, wait.

3. Enjoy!
